# Feedme Trees

This library is intended to support most of the model structures for feed me jefferson. This is not limited to our core binary tree structure, but the binary tree does form a core structure for us and it will require a number of common utility functions that we want to share across different projects. 

## Installation and Usage

For now we aren't publshing this to any centralized registries.

```
npm install
npx tsc
```

Then from other projects, install it as a directory reference.

```
cd ../other-project
npm install -S ../feedme-trees
```

I'll work provide better guidance as I get a little more experienced with this...
